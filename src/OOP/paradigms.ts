/**
 * Composition VS Aggregation
 *
 * Composition: A bicycle is a whole. Wheels, handlebars are parts that don't make sense without the WHOLE (bicycle). Their lifetimes are related.
 * Aggregation: An university is a whole. Teachers / students are parts of it. Teachers and students can exist without specific WHOLE (university). Their lifetimes are note related.
